# PyPacman

PyPacman is a [Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) game made in Python 2.7. In the game, the AI controls both the Pacman and the ghosts. The project was made for the University of Oulu course 521495A.

The project consists of two parts:
1. Pacman search, where the Pacman tries to escape a maze.
2. Standard Pacman, where the Pacman tries to achieve the highest possible score by eating the fruits while avoiding getting eaten by the ghosts
